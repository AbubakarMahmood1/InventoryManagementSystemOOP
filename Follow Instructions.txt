Extract the openjfx-22.0.2_windows-x64_bin-sdk to

C:\JavaFX

and it should look like this afterwards

C:\JavaFX\javafx-sdk-22.0.2

Install, Java 22, and it should look like this

C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-22

Add both "C:\JavaFX\javafx-sdk-22.0.2", and "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-22' to path under system variables.

In case you want to run the application using NetBeans for presentation purpose, Install NetBeans 25/26, and put 

--module-path "C:\JavaFX\javafx-sdk-22.0.2\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

under run VM Options, found through right click on project -> Properties -> Run tab.

Otherwise just use run.bat instead.
